# The active LED is active low instead of active high like other Raspberry Pis
dtparam=act_led_activelow=on

# The default is to blink the LED on MicroSD card accesses, but this isn't
# that useful since Nerves has very few accesses. Switch it to a heartbeat
# so that it's easy to see if the processor hangs.

# To turn the LED completely off comment out the previous line and uncomment
# the next.

# goes off screen, and negative if there is too much border

# uncomment to force a console size. By default it will be display's size minus
# overscan.
